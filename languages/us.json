We also had moments of critical thinking in conjunction with the aforementioned activity. In parallel, in all classes we practiced speaking by reciting a poem at the beginning of each class. We also reviewed reading comprehension and whenever necessary, as the name suggests, we had to use technical English to understand electronic components that we commonly use in subjects such as Industrial Electronics or Telecommunications. <br><br> In the second stage, we worked on composing Curricula Vitae (CVs) and hiring forms for our simulated companies. It should be clarified that to create our forms, we had to complete one to understand its composition. Then, we joined the year-end project. Seeing how an emergency and/or evacuation plan is created and its foundations. We saw the theoretical part and developed our own emergency plan.",

We learned how to configure a router to connect computers on an internal network. To demonstrate the acquired knowledge, we shared files between computers. At the end of the stage, we developed programming skills, creating a website for our simulated company.<br><br> In the second stage, we worked with the installation of cameras and the configuration of DVR (Digital Video Recorder), and differentiated an NVR (Network Video Recorder), the types of connections with the cameras and different connection cables. We saw the operation of sensors, for example, the PIR sensor. We could use this internal network to communicate where the danger is happening; the cameras to monitor the areas; a speaker as an actuator to alert where the danger is and where to go."
